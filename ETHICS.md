<!-- Ethical Considerations for Exams & Holidays Analysis Project -->

API: I utilized the Calendarific API to gather holiday data. I make sure to follow their terms of service and respect any usage limits they have in place.
  
Web Scraping: I scraped exam information from the Jagran Josh website. Before doing so, I checked their robots.txt file to ensure that my scraping activities are respectful and compliant with their guidelines.

No Personal Data: My dataset does not include any personal or sensitive information about individuals.
  
Minimal Data Collection*: I only collected data that is essential for my analysis, ensuring I respect privacy.

  
Clear Documentation: I provided thorough documentation explaining my data sources, methods, and how to use the project.


Data Representation: We recognize that my exam data may not cover all exams in India, and my holiday data might miss some local or regional holidays.
  
Caution in Interpretation: Users should be aware of potential biases in exam scheduling or holiday recognition when analyzing the results.


Educational Intent: This project is designed for educational purposes, aiming to provide insights rather than commercial gain.
  
Accuracy Disclaime: While I strive for accuracy, I cannot guarantee the completeness of the data. Users should verify critical information from official sources.

I adhered to all relevant laws and regulations regarding data protection.
